py2048
======

A cross-platform clone of 2048 using Python 2.7 and pygame.


Dependencies
------------

===LINUX===

_You may not have to install Python,_ as it is installed by default with most
Linux distros.

Arch: `sudo pacman -Sy python2 python2-pygame`

Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pygame`

Fedora: `sudo yum install python pygame`


===WINDOWS===

[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.7/python-2.7.7.msi)

**NOTE:** this is the 32-bit version; pygame only comes in 32-bit

[pygame](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi)


===MAC OS X===

Neither of the devs have a Mac and can attest to this, but theoretically if one
could install Python 2.7 and pygame on the Mac, it will run. This game doesn't
include any OS-specific code.
